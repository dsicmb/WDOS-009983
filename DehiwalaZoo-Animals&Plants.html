                                 <p>Physical description :<br>
                                    Asian elephants are the continent's largest terrestrial mammals. They can reach 6.4m in length and 3m 
                                    at the shoulder, and weigh as much as 5 tonnes. They are smaller than African elephants and have 
                                    proportionally smaller ears, which they keep in constant motion in order to cool themselves. They 
                                    also have a single 'finger' on the upper lip of their trunks as opposed to African elephants, which 
                                    have a second one on the lower tip. Their skin ranges from dark grey to brown, with patches of pink on 
                                    the forehead, the ears, the base of the trunk and the chest. A significant number of male Asian 
                                    elephants are tusk-less. The percentage of males with ivory varies from just 5% in Sri Lanka to around 
                                    90% in southern India - possibly reflecting the intensity of past ivory hunting.<br><br>
                                    Subspecies :<br>
                                    There are three subspecies of Asian elephant – the Indian, Sumatran and Sri Lankan. The Indian has the 
                                    widest range and accounts for the majority of the remaining elephants on the continent. The Sri Lankan 
                                    physically the largest of the subspecies, and also the darkest in colour. The Sumatran is the smallest.
                                    However, some studies suggest that Borneo pygmy elephants could be a separate subspecies. If so, 
                                    they would be the smallest. They are also more rotund and have babyish faces, larger ears, and longer 
                                    tails that almost reach the ground. They are appear to be less aggressive than other Asian elephants. 
                                    Social Structure Female elephants are more social than males. They form herds of related females that 
                                    are led by the oldest female, the 'matriarch'. Males usually live alone but sometimes form small 
                                    groups with other males.<br><br>
                                    Life Cycle :<br>
                                    When habitat conditions are favourable, female elephants may give
                                    birth to a calf every 2.5-4 years. Each calf weighs between 50-150kg. After several months, the calf 
                                    begins to eat grass and foliage. However, it stays under the supervision of its mother for several 
                                    years, starting to make its first independent moves when it is around 4 years old. Both males and 
                                    females may become sexually mature as early as 9, but males do not usually start sexual activity 
                                    until they are 14 or 15. And even then they are not capable of the social dominance that is usually 
                                    necessary for successful reproductive activity, especially as most elephants only reach their full
                                    size at about 17 years of age. <br><br>
                                    Diet : <br>
                                    Elephants need to eat an average of 150 kg per day to survive. 
                                    They can spend more than two thirds of each day feeding on grasses. But they also devour large 
                                    amounts of bark, roots, leaves and stems. Cultivated crops such as bananas, rice and sugarcane are 
                                    also favoured foods - sometimes bringing them into conflict with humans. They need to drink at least
                                    once a day so they are always close to a source of fresh water.</div>

                                    <p>General Habitat :<br>
                                        Good grizzly bear habitat provides all the components necessary for the species’ survival: food, cover,
                                        a place to den, solitude, and plenty of space. Prime grizzly bear habitat features a diversity of plants,
                                        which provides bears with a varied food supply of plants, insects, and animals.Today, grizzly bears are only
                                        found in large tracts of relatively undisturbed land, and a clear relationship exists between the loss of 
                                        grizzly bears and the destruction or fragmentation of their habitat. Bear researchers agree that the most 
                                        crucial element in grizzly bear recovery is to secure adequate habitat.The home range for one grizzly bear may
                                        encompass up to 600 square miles, so space is essential. Because grizzly bears can come into conflict with 
                                        humans and our uses of the land, such as ranching or recreation, good bear habitat must offer some areas that 
                                        are isolated from development or otherwise highly impacted by humans. Roads likely pose the most imminent threat 
                                        to grizzly habitat today, and the management of roads is one of the most powerful tools available to balance the 
                                        needs of people with the needs of bears. In addition, the impacts of logging, mining, livestock grazing, and various 
                                        forms of outdoor recreation in grizzly habitat can be mitigated through well-designed management programs.<br><br>
                                        Diet : <br>
                                        Like humans, the grizzly bear is omnivorous and scavengers by nature, spending most of their waking hours searching for food.
                                        Grizzly bears are adaptable and may eat insects, a variety of flowering plants, roots, tubers, grasses, berries, small rodents, 
                                        fish, carrion (roadkill and other dead animals), other meat sources (e.g. young and weakened animals), and even human garbage if 
                                        it is easily accessible.Grizzly bears are active and feeding for six to eight months in the spring, summer and fall of every year. 
                                        During this time, they must consume large amounts of food in order to survive the winter. Bears in each ecosystem learn where and 
                                        when particular foods are available through their personal experiences, and because of this, biologists have been able to learn and 
                                        generally predict their seasonal distribution and movement.

                                        The coyote is a member of the dog family, along with foxes and wolves.This medium-sized canid bears a 
                                        close resemblance to a small German shepherd with a brown-gray coat and whitish belly.Adults typically 
                                        weigh between 25 and 40 pounds but some larger individuals can weigh up to 50 pounds or more.Coyotes have 
                                        a dark band that runs down the back and onto the tail, which is tipped in black.<br><br>
                                        Distribution:<br>
                                        Over time the distribution of the coyote has come to include most of North America except parts of northern 
                                        Canada. Historically, the coyote was absent from much of the Great Lakes Drainage Basin before European 
                                        settlement. The lands east of the Mississippi were vast deciduous forests inhabited by wolves. Once the 
                                        Europeans arrived they began deforesting and farming the land, quickly finding conflict with the native 
                                        wolves and their livestock. The wolves were extirpated and the coyotes that faced similar persecution in 
                                        the Great Plains immigrated to the newly abandoned territory, quickly increasing in abundance. 
                                        The prevalence of coyotes in these areas can have important ecological implications in their role as apex 
                                        predators and subsequent impacts on prey species,especially in urban areas.<br><br>
                                        Habitat :<br>
                                        Coyotes’ habitat preferences reflect their diet as they are generalists and can utilize any habitat, 
                                        but they are least tolerant of unbroken forested tracts, preferring both natural areas (prairies, bushy 
                                        areas, woodland edges) and human-populated areas (farms, suburbs, and cities).In urban areas they prefer 
                                        wooded patches and green spaces to allow for shelter to avoid humans.<br><br>
                                        Diet :<br>
                                        Coyotes are carnivores, but also opportunistic generalists that will shift their diet to take advantage 
                                        of the most available prey items. An existing misconception about urban coyotes is that they eat primarily 
                                        garbage and pets, but literature reports that 90% of their diet consists of small mammals such as voles, 
                                        shrews, and mice, as well as rabbits, hares, and muskrats. Coyotes will also eat birds, snakes, frogs, and 
                                        insects. Fruits and vegetables are occasionally eaten, especially during the growing season. Urban 
                                        landscapes have surpluses of food resources, including squirrels, rabbits, geese, and other species that
                                        thrive in urban environments. Coyotes can help to control population numbers for these overabundant prey 
                                        species.</p>

                                    <p>Description : <br>
                                        While their obvious most interesting fact is their height, that doesn’t mean these creatures can’t leave
                                        you even more surprised! Giraffes are incredibly unique in a number of different characteristics as well 
                                        as their record-breaking stature.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Long-Necked :<br> 
                                                Much of these creatures’ height comes from their lengthy necks, which can measure well over 6 
                                                feet long alone! You would think that this means they have much more neck bones than humans do…
                                                right? In reality, humans and giraffes have the same number of neck bones, also known as vertebrae.
                                                The only difference is that the giraffe’s seven vertebrae are super sized! </li>
                                            <li> Horns… or Not Horns? : <br>
                                                The hair-covered “horns” on the heads of these creatures are actually known as ossicones. Unlike 
                                                horns, which are coated in keratin, ossicones have a coating of skin and fur. Ossicones are originally
                                                made of cartilage when they are grown, and harden into bone over time.</li>
                                            <li>High Head : <br>
                                                Their unusually long neck makes it difficult for blood to get to the brain. In order to pump blood to 
                                                their brain and extremities, giraffes need large, strong hearts. Their hearts can be as much as two feet
                                                long, and weigh well over 25 lbs.! In comparison, the human heart weighs just 11 ounces.
                                            <li>High-Capacity Consumption : <br>
                                                All of that biological trouble supporting extreme height pays off for these creatures. Being heads, and 
                                                tails, and heads again, above the other herbivores means that giraffes don’t have any competitors in the 
                                                food market. The average individual can eat 75 lbs. of plants per day.</li>

                                        Habitat of the Giraffe : <br>
                                        These creatures are relatively specialized to specific habitats. Though they can survive in a number of different 
                                        ecosystems they have preferences for specific types of trees. This means that they thrive in environments like 
                                        savannahs and sparse woodlands. They are more common in open woodlands than they are in more dense vegetation. 
                                        When food is more scarce they tend to congregate around evergreen trees and bushes.<br><br>
                                        Distribution of the Giraffe : <br>
                                        There are a number of different subspecies (or species depending on what research you believe) spread across 
                                        different regions of Africa. Some populations are quite fragmented, putting them in danger of genetic inbreeding. 
                                        Some populations are found in southern Africa, eastern Africa, and a few areas of sub-Saharan Africa.<br><br>
                                        Diet of the Giraffe :<br>
                                        These large mammals are herbivores, which means that they primarily feed on plants. Their primary diet is the 
                                        leaves of trees and bushes, but they will also eat branches, bark, twigs, and some fruit. Some of their preferred 
                                        plant species are acacia, apricot, and mimosa trees. They use their long tongues to carefully pluck and strip 
                                        leaves from branches.</p>

                                        Rhinos vary in size and weight depending on the species. Their height can range from 4 to 10 feet. 
                                        Sumatran rhinos are the smallest of the living rhinos. On average, their height is between 3.3 and 5 
                                        feet, their length is between 6.5 and 13 feet, and their weight is 1,320 to 2,090 pounds.
                                        Black rhinos are the smaller of the two African rhino species. On average, their height is 5.2 feet and
                                        their weight is between 1,720 and 3,080 pounds. The white rhino is the larger African species, weighing 
                                        3,080 between and 7,920 pounds and standing at a height between 5 and 6 feet.Javan rhinos are 4.6 to 
                                        5.8 feet in height and can weigh between 1,984 and 5,071 pounds. The greater one-horned rhino is the 
                                        largest of the rhino species, with height ranging from 5.75 to 6.5 feet and weight ranging from 4,000 
                                        to 6,000 pounds.<br><br>
                                        Diet :<br>
                                        All five species of rhinos are herbivores, eating mainly vegetation. They spend most of their time 
                                        browsing and grazing through their natural habitat in search of plants and grasses to eat. The specific
                                        types of food that each of the species eats depend upon their habitat and location. Rhinos are one of 
                                        the few remaining megaherbivores, which are plant-eaters that weigh more than 2,000 pounds.<br><br>
                                        Habitat :<br>
                                        Rhinos’ habitats include tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrublands, tropical moist 
                                        forests, deserts and shrublands are among their habitats. Their habitat depends on the species. For 
                                        example, the Sumatran rhino’s habitat is dense highland and lowland tropical and subtropical forests. 
                                        Meanwhile, the white rhino can be found in African grasslands.<br><br>
                                        Geography :<br>
                                        While rhinos once roamed great portions of Africa and Asia, their range has decreased dramatically in 
                                        recent years. Rhinos can currently be found in Borneo and Sumatra, Namibia, the Eastern Himalayas, 
                                        and Coastal East Africa. Their location depends on species. For example, the Sumatran rhino can be 
                                        found on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Meanwhile, the white rhino and the black rhino 
                                        can be found in Africa.<br><br>
                                        Breeding :<br>
                                        Female rhinos give birth to a single calf, which can weigh over 100 pounds. Rhino breeding patterns depend on the species and its habitat. The mother may stay with her calf for up to four years unless she has another baby, in which case she pushes her older calf into independence to make way for the new arrival. Sumatran rhinos are the exception, where the mother will only stay with the calf for two to three years, even if the mother does not have another newborn for another two years.
                                        For the Sumatran rhino, only two captive females have reproduced in the last 15 years. When born, their calves have a dense covering that turns reddish-brown in young adults. This covering later becomes sparse, bristly and near black in older animals.
                                        White rhinos, which have a complex social structure, have different breeding patterns. The home range 
                                        for adult females can be more than seven times larger than males, depending on habitat quality and 
                                        population density. Breeding females are prevented from leaving a dominant male’s territory, which is 
                                        marked and patrolled by its owner on a regular basis.</p>

                            <td>The foliage of philodendrons is usually green but may be coppery, red, or purplish; parallel leaf 
                                veins are usually green or sometimes red or white. Juvenile and adult phases differ, making it almost 
                                impossible to identify different species of small plants.Most philodendrons are great climbers, usually
                                growing upward by wrapping their modified roots around the trunks of trees. Once they have worked their way up to the canopy, they often transform 
                                themselves into epiphytes. Plants with this life strategy are called secondary hemiepiphytes. 
                                Unlike most plants, the seedlings of hemiepiphytes do not grow toward the Sun; instead they grow 
                                toward a tree trunk.<br><br>
