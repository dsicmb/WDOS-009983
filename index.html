                    <P>
                        Dehiwala Zoo logo is about to unveil an unprecidented meaning  that is quite unique to the pearl of the Indian Ocean . 
                        It is our utmost delight to declare that this logo depicts a generic feline  that represents the 03 wild cats that are 
                        indigenous to Sri Lanka, namely,<br><br>
                        <ol class = small-roman>
                            <li>SRI LANKAN LEOPARD</li>
                            <li>SRI LANKAN BLACK-PANTHER</li>
                            <li>SRI LANKAN RUSTY-SPOTTED WILD CAT</li>
                        </ol><br>
                        Also  the logo is made up of a plant element – leaves and twigs of <em>BATADOMBA</em> tree , which is native to Sri Lanka & 
                        can be found in <em>SINHARAJA</em> rainforest abundantly  and we are proud to say that this magnificent tree can be seen in 
                        our zoological garden premises as well .As a tropical island both wildlife & fauna play a major role that cannot be comprised as 
                        far its natural equilibrium is concerned & as a zoological garden we already have embarked on a noble mission  not only by 
                        conservinging & preserving them but also educating the future generation in such a way that they will take any step in order 
                        to protect their mother nature. As a zoological garden that is our vision. So welcome aboard & lets protect our motherland 
                        as one family ...

                                    <h4>A <br>LITTLE bit of information about this LITTLE <br>wild cat</h4><br>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>The smallest cat in the world, about the size of a six month old domestic cat, the rusty, like its name suggests, 
                                    has short brownish-grey fur, overlaid by a rufous hue – though in Sri Lanka, it has a more russet colour. The cat’s 
                                    face has two dark streaks that run along each cheek and four stripes extending above its eyes, back between the ears 
                                    and then down along the shoulders, eventually tapering off to elongated spots. These elongated spots can also be seen
                                    along its flanks as very faint rusty-brown spots and blotches. Its throat, chest and belly are stark white, and marked
                                    with large black spots and bars, much like that of a leopard. It has small rounded ears, black soled feet, and a tail 
                                    that is just about half its body length.<br><br>
                                    After all, who wouldn't fall in love with a 1 kg rusty-spotted cat, so tiny it can fit in the palm of your hand? ... 
                                    Whilst owning these cats is not illegal, like dog-wolf hybrids, these mongrels are not tame as they still have their 
                                    wild side present and it is safe to say that they don't make good pets either.
                                    </p>

                                <p>Our Orchid Arcade simulates the experience of ascending through a tropical rainforest and showcases a diversity of orchids from the rich low to high-elevation rainforests around the world . Each of the display houses within the Orchid Archade has been expanded beyond their original size, increasing by almost threefold the combined display area.<br><br>
                                    We preserved part of the original frame of the original cool house and curated the orchid collection in the new Arcade according to five biogeographical regions – Malesia, Continental Southeast Asia and South Asia, Australasia, Afrotropics and the Neotropics. Researchers will be able to study rare orchids that are naturally found only at higher elevations, 
                                    such as such as Cymbidiums (also known as Boat Orchids),Dendrochilums (also known as Chain Orchids), Cyrtochilums and Phragmipediums (also known as Slipper Orchids). This will greatly benefit taxonomic and floristic research, as researchers will be able to grow rare species, before identifying and documenting them at a later stage when they flower.
